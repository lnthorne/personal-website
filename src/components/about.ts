export const aboutMe = `
Hello! I'm Liam, a recent Computer Science graduate from Simon Fraser University, where\n
I completed my degree with a strong academic record and practical experience across\n
various tech fields. With a passion for all aspects of development, I’ve been fortunate\n
to work on diverse projects, including gaming, full-stack web development, and mobile\n
app creation.\n
\n
During my time as a Software Developer at Arc'teryx, I enhanced their e-commerce platform\n
by migrating the CMS to Sanity.io and redesigning the user authentication system.\n
Additionally, I contributed to impactful projects, such as building a mobile application\n
for refugee rehabilitation in Uganda and developing an AR-based geolocation app for\n
immersive digital storytelling.\n
\n
Skilled in languages like C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I’m always excited to bring\n
new ideas to life through technology. Check out my GitHub to see what I’m working on!\n
